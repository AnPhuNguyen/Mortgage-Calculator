# Mortgage-Calculator
My first project, followed from YouTube: Programming with Mosh's "Java Full Course for Beginners" https://youtu.be/eIrMbAQSU34?t=8520
there are currently 2 versions: console IO and File IO. Each is putted in separated java, but both use same Loan class for calculation (I would like to call it the core class)

console version is, as expected: run code in a code editor, and then type stuffs on console
File IO version, aside from having similar operation with above,  will require you to open a txt file on your system and 
read the first 3 numbers that present on  (if choose exactly .txt file). For now, file explorer interface is using java's.

there might be a few mistakes in logic of code, or points for optimization. I would look forward to your feedback on this project soon
